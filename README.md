# 👋 Hey I’m Aniruddha Ganguly

I build smooth and scalable e-commerce experiences with React and Next.js and I like keeping things fast clean and easy to use. My work on the frontend naturally pulled me toward the world of data because the more I played with APIs the more I wondered what stories the data could tell and what cool automations it could power.

Now I’m steadily moving toward data focused work. I’m learning how data flows behind the scenes and how to turn raw information into something meaningful and usable. It’s the beginning of my data engineering journey and I’m enjoying figuring it all out.
